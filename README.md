# SALES-PREDICTION-USING-PYTHON-
Sales prediction is a crucial task in business analytics, aiming to forecast the amount of product sales based on various factors such as advertising expenditure. This project utilizes a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using Python.
# Sales Prediction Using Python

This project predicts product sales based on advertising expenditures, specifically focusing on the impact of TV advertising. It employs a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship between TV advertising budgets and sales figures.

## Overview

In businesses, predicting sales helps optimize advertising strategies. This project demonstrates using Python for data analysis and machine learning to forecast sales based on historical advertising data.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Advertising dataset from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISLR). It includes columns for TV, radio, newspaper advertising budgets, and sales figures.

## Objective

The goal is to build a predictive model that businesses can use to understand how changes in TV advertising spending affect sales. This helps in making informed decisions about advertising budgets.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models

## Files Included

- `sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and model building.
- `Advertising.csv`: Dataset file used in the analysis.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
